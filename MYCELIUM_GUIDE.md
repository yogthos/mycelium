# Mycelium — LLM Quick-Start Guide

> Load this file into context when working with Mycelium projects.

## What It Is

Mycelium is a Clojure workflow framework built on [Maestro](https://github.com/yogthos/maestro). Applications are directed graphs of **cells** (pure data transformations) with Malli schema contracts on every input/output boundary. Cells are developed and tested in isolation, then composed into workflows validated at compile time.

**Key namespace:** `mycelium.core` (aliased as `myc`) — re-exports all public API functions.

## Core Concepts

### Cell

A function with schema contracts, registered via multimethod:

```clojure
(ns my.cells
  (:require [mycelium.cell :as cell]))

(defmethod cell/cell-spec :my/double [_]
  {:id      :my/double
   :handler (fn [resources data]
              (assoc data :result (* 2 (:x data))))
   :schema  {:input  [:map [:x :int]]
             :output [:map [:result :int]]}})
```

**Rules:**
- Handler signature: `(fn [resources data] -> data)` — always returns enriched data map
- `:input` / `:output` are [Malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli) schemas
- Cells never import or call other cells — they only see `resources` and `data`
- Resources (DB, HTTP clients, atoms) are injected, never acquired
- `:requires [:db :cache]` documents resource dependencies (informational)

### Workflow

A directed graph connecting cells:

```clojure
{:cells      {:start  :my/validate
              :step-b :my/process
              :step-c :my/render}
 :edges      {:start  {:valid :step-b, :invalid :end}
              :step-b :step-c
              :step-c :end}
 :dispatches {:start [[:valid   (fn [d] (= :ok (:status d)))]
                      [:invalid (fn [d] (not= :ok (:status d)))]]}}
```

**Edges** define topology. **Dispatches** are ordered `[label pred]` vectors — first matching predicate wins. Unconditional edges (keyword target) need no dispatch entry. Empty `:dispatches {}` is valid when all edges are unconditional.

### Pipeline Shorthand

For linear (unbranched) workflows, use `:pipeline` instead of `:edges` + `:dispatches`:

```clojure
{:cells    {:start :my/validate, :process :my/process, :render :my/render}
 :pipeline [:start :process :render]}
;; Expands to: {:edges {:start :process, :process :render, :render :end}, :dispatches {}}
```

Mutually exclusive with `:edges`, `:dispatches`, and `:joins`.

### Data Model

Cells communicate through an **accumulating data map**. Every cell receives all keys produced by every prior cell in the path. Cells `assoc` new keys; the enriched map flows forward.

```
start (has :x) → validate (adds :status) → process (sees :x AND :status, adds :result) → end
```

### Per-Transition Output Schemas

Cells with multiple outgoing edges can declare different output schemas per transition:

```clojure
:schema {:input  [:map [:id :string]]
         :output {:found     [:map [:profile [:map [:name :string]]]]
                  :not-found [:map [:error-message :string]]}}
```

The schema chain validator tracks keys per path independently.

## Running Workflows

```clojure
(require '[mycelium.core :as myc])

;; One-shot (compiles + runs)
(myc/run-workflow workflow-def resources initial-data)

;; Pre-compiled (zero overhead per call — use for production)
(def compiled (myc/pre-compile workflow-def))
(myc/run-compiled compiled resources initial-data)

;; Async variants
(myc/run-workflow-async workflow-def resources initial-data)
(myc/run-compiled-async compiled resources initial-data)
```

## Composition — Workflows as Cells

Nest a workflow inside a parent by wrapping it as a cell:

```clojure
(require '[mycelium.compose :as compose])

(compose/register-workflow-cell!
  :my/sub-workflow
  {:cells {:start :my/a, :step2 :my/b}
   :pipeline [:start :step2]}
  {:input  [:map [:x :int]]
   :output [:map [:result :int]]})  ;; or :map to infer

;; Use in parent:
{:cells {:start :my/sub-workflow, :next :my/downstream}
 :edges {:start {:success :next, :failure :error}
         :next  :end}}
;; No explicit dispatches needed — composed cells provide :default-dispatches
```

**Output inference:** `workflow->cell` automatically infers the composed cell's output schema by walking the child workflow's end-reaching cells. If you pass a concrete `[:map ...]` vector as `:output`, it takes precedence. Pass `:map` to use inference.

**Default dispatches:** `:success` (no `:mycelium/error`) and `:failure` (`:mycelium/error` present) are provided automatically.

## Join Nodes (Fork-Join)

Run cells in parallel (or sequential), merge results:

```clojure
{:cells {:start :my/auth, :a :my/fetch-profile, :b :my/fetch-orders, :render :my/page}
 :joins {:fetch-data {:cells [:a :b], :strategy :parallel}}
 :edges {:start {:ok :fetch-data, :fail :error}
         :fetch-data {:done :render, :failure :error}
         :render :end}
 :dispatches {:start [[:ok (fn [d] (:authed d))] [:fail (fn [d] (not (:authed d)))]]}}
```

- Join members exist in `:cells` but have **no entries in `:edges`**
- Each member gets a **snapshot** of the input data (branches don't see each other)
- Default dispatches: `:done` / `:failure` (provided automatically)
- Without `:merge-fn`, results are merged via `(apply merge data results)` — output keys must be disjoint
- With `:merge-fn`: `(fn [data results-vec] -> merged-data)`

## Manifests (EDN)

Define workflows as data in `.edn` files:

```clojure
{:id :user-onboarding
 :cells {:start   {:id :auth/parse, :schema {:input [...] :output [...]}, :doc "..."}
         :validate {:id :auth/check, :schema :inherit}}  ;; :inherit pulls from registry
 :edges {:start {:ok :validate}, :validate :end}
 :dispatches {:start [[:ok (fn [d] (:user-id d))]]}}
```

```clojure
(def m (myc/load-manifest "workflows/user-onboarding.edn"))
(myc/cell-brief m :start)  ;; Self-contained prompt for an LLM to implement the cell
```

## Dev & Testing

```clojure
(require '[mycelium.dev :as dev])

;; Test a cell in isolation
(dev/test-cell :my/cell-id
  {:input {:x 5} :resources {} :dispatches [[:ok pred] [:fail pred]]})
;; => {:pass? true, :output {...}, :matched-dispatch :ok, :duration-ms 0.4}

;; Test multiple transitions at once
(dev/test-transitions :my/cell-id
  {:ok   {:input {:x 5}  :dispatches [[:ok pred] [:fail pred]]}
   :fail {:input {:x -1} :dispatches [[:ok pred] [:fail pred]]}})
;; => {:ok {:pass? true, ...}, :fail {:pass? true, ...}}

;; Cells without dispatch predicates — output-only check
(dev/test-transitions :my/classify
  {:low  {:input {:score 750}}
   :high {:input {:score 400}}})

;; See accumulated schema at each workflow step
(myc/infer-workflow-schema workflow-def)
;; => {:start  {:available-before #{:x}, :adds #{:status}, :available-after #{:x :status}}
;;     :step-b {:available-before #{:x :status}, :adds #{:result}, ...}}

;; Enumerate all paths through a workflow
(dev/enumerate-paths manifest)

;; Static analysis (reachability, cycles, dead ends)
(dev/analyze-workflow workflow-def)

;; DOT graph for visualization
(dev/workflow->dot manifest)  ;; pipe to `dot -Tpng`

;; Implementation status
(dev/workflow-status manifest)
;; => {:total 4, :passing 2, :failing 1, :pending 1, :cells [...]}
```

## Ring Middleware

```clojure
(def compiled (myc/pre-compile workflow-def))

;; Create a handler
(myc/workflow-handler compiled
  {:resources {:db db-conn}
   :input-fn  (fn [req] {:http-request req})
   :output-fn myc/html-response})
```

## Compile-Time Validations

`compile-workflow` checks before any code runs:

| Check | What it catches |
|-------|-----------------|
| Cell existence | All `:cells` values are registered |
| Edge targets | Targets point to valid cells, joins, or `:end`/`:error`/`:halt` |
| Reachability | Every cell reachable from `:start` |
| Dispatch coverage | Every edge label has a predicate (and vice versa) |
| Schema chain | Each cell's input keys available from upstream outputs |
| Join validation | Members exist, no name collisions, disjoint outputs |
| No-path-to-end | No reachable state stuck without path to `:end` |

## Common Patterns

### Implementing a Cell from a Brief

When you receive a cell brief (from `cell-brief`), implement it as:

```clojure
(defmethod cell/cell-spec :namespace/cell-name [_]
  {:id      :namespace/cell-name
   :handler (fn [resources data]
              ;; Your logic here — assoc results into data
              (assoc data :output-key computed-value))
   :schema  {:input  [:map [:required-key :type] ...]
             :output [:map [:output-key :type] ...]}})
```

### Testing Workflow

1. Implement cells with `defmethod cell/cell-spec`
2. Test each cell in isolation: `(dev/test-cell :id {:input {...}})`
3. Test dispatch paths: `(dev/test-transitions :id {:label {:input {...} :dispatches [...]}})`
4. Compile the workflow: `(myc/compile-workflow workflow-def)` — catches schema chain errors
5. Run end-to-end: `(myc/run-workflow workflow-def resources data)`
6. Assert on `:mycelium/trace` in the result for execution order

### Error Handling

- Schema violations redirect to `::fsm/error` with `:mycelium/schema-error` in data
- Custom error handling: pass `:on-error (fn [resources fsm-state] -> data)` to `compile-workflow`
- Composed cells set `:mycelium/error` on failure for parent dispatch routing
- Join errors collected in `:mycelium/join-error`

### Gotchas

- `::fsm/start` is NOT terminal — it runs a handler. Only `::end`, `::error`, `::halt` are terminal.
- Handlers receive `(resources, data)` — not the full FSM state.
- Dispatch predicates receive `data` (not fsm-state) — first truthy match wins.
- Ring's `wrap-params` produces STRING-keyed query params — cells must check both `(get qp :key)` and `(get qp "key")`.
- `:schema :inherit` in manifests resolves schema from cell registry — the cell must already be registered.
- Composed cell output schemas are inferred automatically. Only use `set-cell-schema!` if you need to override the inference.
